# Filesharing_TCP
File sharing with sockets in python

Required libraries to run the code

For sending the file across the same localhost, there is no need to change the code. Run the client and server in the same machine to share the file. 
For sending the file across different hosts, change the ip address in the codes respectively according to server and client and run the code to share files.

Note: Run the server code first and the client code later. (TWO IPYNB FILES ATTACHED).
